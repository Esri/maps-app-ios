# Prerelease Example Map Select App
A pre-release version of the up-coming Example Maps App, just for TechCrunch 2017 NYC Hackathon.

It shows:

* Geocoding.
* Revese Geocoding.
* Directions (Routing).
* Using GPS with the ArcGIS Runtime.
* Browsing an ArcGIS Online account for maps and opening them.
* Handling OAuth.

Download and install the [iOS Runtime SDK](https://developers.arcgis.com/ios/).

Then come and see Nick Furness at the Esri Booth if you have any questions. This is pre-release example app and anything may change and lots of things might not work or pretend to not work :)

This repo will eventually be removed and replaced by one at https://github.com/esri.
